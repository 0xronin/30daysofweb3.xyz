![Intro To Blockchain]()

## Blockchain Transactions

Any 'write' operation to the blockchain is a transaction. This includes everything from deploying a smart contract onto the chain, purchasing an NFT, purchasing an ENS name, etc. 

Transactions are requests for your action to be validated and added to the chain. Transactions cost gas fees, an amount of Eth that fluxuates based on network traffic. When there is a lot of traffice, miners can be more picky with their prices. This of it like Uber- if you're at an airport with a bunch of people getting Ubers, the prices go u and the wait times go up. 



## Smart Contracts

A *smart contract* is a computer program compiled from code that can control events and actions according to the terms set within the contract’s code. 

Much like vending machines, we can program smart contracts with various functions. Vending machines allow consumers to insert a currency and then press a button to execute that transaction. A refreshing soda or a candybar is dispensed, and any leftover change that the consumer is owed is dispensed as well. 

A smart contract is just like any other file with executable code, what makes it innovative is its built in support for moving ETH, real money, around. 


## Crypto Wallets

A crypto wallet is a storage system for your digital assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and more. The contents of each crypto wallet can be accessed by a unique key made of a combination of letters and numbers explicitly assigned to the wallet’s creator (called a private key).
