## Crypto Wallet

A crypto wallet is a storage system for your digital assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and more. The contents of each crypto wallet can be accessed by a unique key made of a combination of letters and numbers explicitly assigned to the wallet’s creator (called a private key). 

A crypto wallet’s public key is the public address of the user’s wallet. Think of it as a business address available publicly on the web. Anyone can use a wallet’s public key to look up and verify transaction information, however, personal information is not posted to the blockchain. 

There are many forms of crypto wallets, with many options being available digitally like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Phantom wallet. While there are many options available as browser extensions and mobile apps, there are also hardware wallets (physical devices that store and protect your private keys). 

A hot wallet is one of the most common ways to store crypto assets. It’s a very convenient option because it’s typically accessed via web, mobile, or desktop. However, because hot wallets are always online, they are more vulnerable to attacks.

For best safety practices, a cold wallet is recommended. Unlike hot wallets, cold wallets are hardware devices that require physical input to unlock. While cold wallets aren’t as convenient and are less accessible due to costing a fee to purchase, they provide the best security, as no one can access their contents without interacting in person with the hardware wallet. Some popular cold storage options include Ledger and Trezor.

## Blockchain Transactions

The first step in a blockchain transaction usually starts with a user requesting a transaction. In order to successfully execute a transaction on the Blockchain, a gas fee (a transaction fee on the blockchain) is typically required. Gas fees are something that all users must pay in order to perform a function on the blockchain. The amount of gas required to pay varies depending on which blockchain you’re using, as well as other factors like high traffic. According to [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-are-gas-fees-gwei-gas-fees-eth-ether-transaction-fee), the amount of these transaction fees can vary from less than 0.0001 USD to over 100 USD.  

Once the transaction has been requested, it gets authenticated and added to a block (which represents the transaction across the blockchain). These blocks each have a maximum storage capacity so that once the capacity is reached, the blocks are closed and linked to the previously filled block. Also, these blocks contain information like digital signatures, a timestamp, and any other important information. The block is sent out to the entirety of the network’s *nodes* (participants on the blockchain). 

Afterward, nodes validate the transaction and then receive a reward (usually, the reward will be that blockchain’s main cryptocurrency) for participating in the validation process.  Then, the block gets officially added to the existing blockchain. Afterward, the blockchain receives an update across the entire network and officially reflects that transaction. The transaction is now complete.

Now that we have learned a bit about how blockchain transactions work, we will be taking a look at smart contracts next!

## Smart Contracts

A *smart contract* is a computer program compiled from code that can control events and actions according to the terms set within the contract’s code. To further simplify, a [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) can be thought of as a virtual vending machine programmed by a code set to follow a specific set of rules. 

Much like vending machines, we can program smart contracts with various functions. Vending machines allow consumers to insert a currency and then press a button to execute that transaction. A refreshing soda or a candybar is dispensed, and any leftover change that the consumer is owed is dispensed as well. 

Smart contracts can be programmed to accept payment and can return an item in place of that payment. An example of this would be a “mint” button on a project’s website. *Minting is the* process of taking a digital asset like a photo and publishing that asset to the blockchain. Many NFT projects with a minting website will have a smart contract designed so that whenever the buyer pays a specified fee, they can “mint” a project’s NFT. Then, the smart contract activates the function that accepts the buyer’s payment and follows that function up with another one that distributes a randomly-generated NFT to the buyer. 

In another example, some websites allow you to swap one cryptocurrency into a different one. Popular sites like Uniswap have options to swap between many different cryptocurrencies. Each time a user goes to execute a swap, a function tied to a smart contract is triggered. Like the vending machine, the swapping smart contract accepts the user’s payment then sends the user the currency they requested in return. 

## Crypto Wallets

A crypto wallet is a storage system for your digital assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and more. The contents of each crypto wallet can be accessed by a unique key made of a combination of letters and numbers explicitly assigned to the wallet’s creator (called a private key). 

A crypto wallet’s public key is the public address of the user’s wallet. Think of it as a business address available publicly on the web. Anyone can use a wallet’s public key to look up and verify transaction information, however, personal information is not posted to the blockchain. 

There are many forms of crypto wallets, with many options being available digitally like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Phantom wallet. While there are many options available as browser extensions and mobile apps, there are also hardware wallets (physical devices that store and protect your private keys). 

A hot wallet is one of the most common ways to store crypto assets. It’s a very convenient option because it’s typically accessed via web, mobile, or desktop. However, because hot wallets are always online, they are more vulnerable to attacks.

For best safety practices, a cold wallet is recommended. Unlike hot wallets, cold wallets are hardware devices that require physical input to unlock.
