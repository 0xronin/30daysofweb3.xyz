A **crypto wallet** is _a storage system for your digital assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and more_. The contents of each crypto wallet can be accessed by a unique key made of a combination of letters and numbers explicitly assigned to the wallet’s creator (called a **private key**).

A crypto wallet’s **public key** is _the public address of the user’s wallet_. Think of it as a business address available publicly on the web. Anyone can use a wallet’s public key to look up and verify transaction information, however, personal information is not posted to the blockchain.

There are many forms of crypto wallets, with many options being available digitally like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Phantom wallet. While there are many options available as browser extensions and mobile apps, there are also **hardware wallets** (_physical devices that store and protect your private keys_).

A **hot wallet** is one of the most common ways to store crypto assets. It’s a very convenient option because it’s typically accessed via web, mobile, or desktop. However, _because hot wallets are always online, they are more vulnerable to attacks_.

**For best safety practices, a cold wallet is recommended.** Unlike hot wallets, **cold wallets** are _hardware devices that require physical input to unlock_. While cold wallets aren’t as convenient and are less accessible due to costing a fee to purchase, they provide the best security, as no one can access their contents without interacting in person with the hardware wallet. Some popular cold storage options include Ledger and Trezor.
