## üëã Welcome to 30 Days of Web3!

If you're reading this, you're here to build dope dapps ‚Äî Welcome!

This course is for devs that want to start building on Ethereum, one of the biggest blockchains in the world.

This course will focus on big-picture architecture and will help you define your web3 tech stack that you'll be able to use to build any idea you have.

Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of how to navigate your terminal
- Basic JavaScript
- Basic React

It's helpful to be familiar with the aforementioned, but you'll pick up everything along the way.

## üöÄ Before Starting

This course is fully async, online, and created to only take 30-45 mins daily to ship in 30 days. If you're not planning to apply for the BUIDL Accelerator, you can feel free to go through this project at your own pace.

For women and non-binary devs applying to our BUIDL Accelerator, you must finish this course within the next **40 days** in order to meet the application deadline. More details on the BUIDL Accelerator will be released soon.

## üëÄ Project Overview

## üèÅ Checkpoints

Throughout the course, there'll be checkpoints for you to test what you've learned and earn [kudos](https://mintkudos.xyz/), which are unique, peer-verified non-transferrable tokens.

These checkpoints are **optional** but highly recommended, especially for those looking to apply to our BUIDL Accelerator.

## üóì Workshops

Mark your calendars to attend live workshops! These workshops will supplement the curriculum and give you opportunities to learn from experienced web3 devs and ask questions live. Stay tuned to the **#events-and-workshops** channel for workshop details.

Recordings of the workshops will be posted in the **#workshop-recordings** channel.

## ü§ö Getting Help

When you have a question, drop a message in the Discord server in the channel that corresponds to the section you're in.

This project is broken up into 9 sections, and you'll see a help channel for each section where a member of the WBW3 team will help you out.

There will also be office hours during which you can ask questions, pair program, and co-work with others. Office hours will be added to **#events-and-workshops** channel, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled there.
