You should now have a new folder with this structure:

```
subgraph-name
â””â”€â”€â”€abis
â”‚   â”‚  {Name}.json
â””â”€â”€â”€generated
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€{Name}
â”‚       â”‚   {Name}.ts
â”‚   â”‚   schema.ts
â”‚   networks.json
â”‚   package.json
â”‚   schema.graphql
â””â”€â”€â”€src
â”‚  â”‚   {Name}.ts
â”‚   subgraph.yaml
â”‚   tsconfig.json
â”‚   yarn.lock
```

Make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the dependencies. If you are using git, add a `.gitignore` file to ignore the `node_modules` folder.

We will also add `@protofire/subgraph-toolkit` as a dependency. Run `yarn add @protofire/subgraph-toolkit` or `npm install @protofire/subgraph-toolkit` to add this package.

The initial setup should have already grabbed the contract ABI for you. If you donâ€™t see it in the abis folder, you can find the abi in your hardhat project in the artifacts folder. It will be called `[YourContractName].json`.

The three main files in the subgraph project folder we will be changing are the `subgraph.yaml`, `schema.graphql`, and `src/{Name}.ts` files.
