## Ethereum Scaling Solutions

Ethereum has become one of the most popular blockchains for a while due to its ability to employ Turing complete smart-contracts. Though, after it gained popularity there has been a significant network congestion as a result high gas fees.

## Difference Between Ethereum L1, L2 and Sidechains

**L1 Blockchain** _refers to the main blockchain layer such as Ethereum_. Layer1 scaling solutions are implemented directly on the main blockchain thus deriving the name on-chain solutions. Some examples of the on-chain scaling solution involve Consensus Protocol Switch and Sharding.

**L2 Blockchains** _are add-on solutions built on the base layer_. Thus deriving the name off-chain scaling solution, since they intend to take away workload from the blockchain while utilizing its security.

**Sidechains** are _Ethereum-compatible independent blockchains with their own consensus model_. Sidechains achieve interoperability with Ethereum by the use of the same EVM. Since they are independent from the main-chain side chains are responsible for their own security. If a sidechainâ€™s security is compromised it will pose no impact to the mainchain.

In this program, we will focus on developing applications mainly on the Polygon sidechain.

## What Is Polygon?

**Polygon** is _a scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing sidechains for off-chain computation and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators._

Polygon strives to solve the scalability and usability issues while not compromising on decentralization and leveraging the existing developer community and ecosystem. Polygon is an off-/sidechain scaling solution for existing platforms to provide scalability and superior user experience to DApps and user functionalities.

## Why Would A Developer Choose Polygon?

The main blockchain (Layer 1) is usually slow. Sidechains such as Polygon were created as a solution to speed up the blockchain without having to compromise its security and decentralization thus an improved user experience and reduce network congestion.

Transaction fees are cheaper on Polygon, making Ethereum more inclusive and accessible by everyone. This is made possible through the application of rollups which work by rolling a number of transactions into batches.
