## Verifying your contract

At this point, your contract should be deployed and you should have your contract’s address copied. Paste it in the Polygon Mumbai block explorer: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/.

You might notice that the contract tab on Polygonscan doesn’t have a copy of your contract code like blockchain scanner sites (like Etherscan) might.

To fix this, we can give Polygonscan our contract code so that it:

- Knows the correct names for events.
- Is readable for developers.

Using the search bar, paste the contract deployment address shown inside your terminal.

Click the ‘Contract’ tab on Polygonscan and hit ‘Verify and publish’.

Select 'single file' and the correct compiler that matches your contract. In our case, it's 0.8.4 and 'no license'.

Finally, copy everything from your smart contract file and paste it into the box on Polygonscan, and hit 'verify and pubish.' You will get brought to a new page that shows a Compiler Output tab. It should say something similar to: `Note: Contract was created during TxHash# 0x0f5b4cf1be68a6b82fc88f1d6a9431b40e9662e16ee68a82fe31489bbec99eeb` and `Successfully generated ByteCode and ABI for Contract Address` if the contract was successfully verified.
