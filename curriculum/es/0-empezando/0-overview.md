# Welcome to 30 Days of Web3! ESPANOL 

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
If you're reading this, you're here to build dope dapps â€” Welcome! 

This course is for devs that want to start building on Ethereum, one of the biggest blockchains in the world.

This course will focus on big-picture architecture and will help you define your web3 techstack that you'll be able to use to build any idea you have. 

Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of how to navigate your terminal
- Basic Javscript
- Basic React

It's helpful to be familiar with the aforementioned, but you'll pick up everything along the way. 

## Before Starting:

Join the Discord by clicking [here](https://discord.com/invite/z63rfurXMD) - here's where you'll be able to ask questions, connect with speakers, and get the alpha on prizes we're giving away. 

Mark your calendars to attend the live workshops. These workshops will supplement the curriculum and give ya'll opportunities to ask questions live and get live, structured education. If you can't attend, all of the videos will be posted in the discord under #workshop-recordings.

This course is fully async, online, and created to only take 30-45mins daily to ship in 30 days. This acts as a prerequisite for women and nb devs applying to our BUIDL Accelerator. In order to meet the deadline application for BUIDL, you'll have to finish this project within the next **40 days**. If you're not planning to apply for the accelerator, you can feel free to go through this project at your own pace.
